# Hi there, my first project in GitHub!

This project is my personal portfolio.

### Tools:

The project was made by me using React, with tools like React Context, Effect, State, Router, etc.

### Visit the page:

To take a look in web: https://lorenzomentesana1.web.app/

### How it was made:

1) I decided to start with the entire web design in Canva.
2) Get all the necessary images/png.
3) When the design was ready, I developed the Nav.
4) I created the components like buttons and icons.
5) Then I continue with the pages and router.
6) After that I developed the Context and Lenguages.
7) I adapted It to the design and made the CSS.
8) Then I added the Projects.

### Structure:
-Folder 'pages' contains the pages structures(containers) in order to make the portfolio a single page app.
-Folder 'componentes' contains components like buttons, icons and other React components.
-Folder 'contexts' contains the React context in order to make global the lenguages.
-Folder 'estilos' contains the styles CSS for every page and component.
-Folder 'lang' contains JSON files used to provide the lenguages.
-Folder 'imagenes' contains elements like pngs and images.
-Then the files index.js and App.js are the usual files in a React app.
